## Why Microshare?
---------------------------------------

Billions of new devices are coming online every year generating zettabytes of new data. How will you enable selective, timely and controlled sharing of that data while maintaining integrity, privacy and security?

## Data Manipulation
---------------------------------------

###### Store it
From Bluetooth to LoRa to Zigbee, we bring together IoT data from all sources and sensors.

###### Enrich it
Add on-premise or cloud data with our APIData universal connectors.

###### Process it
Use our APIFlow process engine to automate data and work.

###### Microshare it
Allow access to only the parties you want.

## How it works ?
---------------------------------------

Microshare’s plug-n-play IoT modules.
Our modular, scalable solutions power data insights in small installations or mega facilities.

#### No technology training required

Your pre-registered sensors install in minutes with average battery life of 5 years. Mount to walls and tables with standard screws, tape and silicone. Activate a local LoRaWAN gateway with our “Installation Guide.” And all of your sensors are managed centrally so data populates your Microshare smart facility application in minutes.

#### The technology behind the curtain
