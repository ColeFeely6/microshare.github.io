---------------------------------------


## 1. Architecture
- The platform is built as a set of microservices, which can be used independently to support your own offering.
- The entire stack operates as JSON based RESTful API calls, making it easy to interoperate with other systems.
- Data can be stored both in our Data Lake and in any other storage on-premise or in the cloud.

## 2. Runs everywhere
- Microshare™ can run as-a-service from our secure cloud.
- We can run all or part of the service in your Data Center. 
- We can also run directly on devices.

## 3. Proven embedded
- Part of the Microshare™ platform has already successfully been integrated in other software by large publicly traded enterprise software companies.
- Proven code quality through seamless integration and external audits (e.g. Black Duck).
