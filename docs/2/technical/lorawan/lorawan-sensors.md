## 1. Introduction
---------------------------------------
Microshare's Smart Facilities solutions are powered by devices that quickly and effectively deliver data to your dashboard. From Predictive Cleaning to Environment Monitoring, Microshare provides boundless opportunities to syncronize you and your data. 

LoRaWAN devices offer a more effiecient solution to communicate data than cellular or WiFi. Sending information via Lora, the range of communication increases to hundreds of square kilometers. The power efficiency of LoRa Devices far exceed their WiFi or Cellular counterparts, giving a battery life of your devices up to six years. 

Microshare sets up your solution before it even arrives to your door, giving you a plug and play' experience. The following are the types of sensors that you will become familiar with working with Microshare. Have more questions on Microshare's solutions? Please refer to our [main page](https://www.microshare.io/smart-facilities-dashboards-and-solutions/)

## 2. Types of Sensors
---------------------------------------

### A. Motion Sensors

Motion sensors have a variety of applications throughout you environment. Motions Sensors have been used to provide Desk Occupany, Room Occupancy, Smart Parking, predictive cleaning and Activity Level monitoring solutions. 

### B. Temperature and Humidity Devices

Microshare works with both indoor and outdoor specific sensors which monitor environmental changes to various locations. Temperature and Humidity Sensors are applied in Indoor Air Quality monitoring, environment monitoring, fridge monitoring and Legionella Prevention solutions. 

### C. Feedback Sensors

Feedback devices allow you to collect realtime responses from your target audience, and are used in feedback stations and Smart Timecard solutions.

### D. Water Leakage

The water leakage solution detects and alerts facilities managers of a potential major issue. Using a small probe, devices can be conveniently placed in areas at risk.

### E. Ambient Light

The Ambient Light Sensor allows you to moniter light intensity throughout various rooms in your facility and is applied in the Brightness and Envirnonment Monitoring Solutions. 

### F. Waste Management

The Waste Management sensor detects and predicts an overflowing trash bin, improving cleaniness of facilities and improving predictibility of collection routes. 

## 3. Sensors Microshare Uses
---------------------------------------

Microshare works with various models of LoRaWAN sensors to deliver a versitile platform of data collection and management. 

### A. Browan Sensors

Microshare employs Browan Sensors for indoor monitoring solutions.

#### Tabs Motion Sensor 

US Model Number: TBMS100-915
EU Model Number: TBMS100-868

The Tabs Motion Sensor uses a Passive Infared Detector and Fresnel Lens to detect and communicate the presense of a person in a room.

### D. Adeunis Temp 3

US Model Number: ARF8170RA
EU Model Number: ARF8180BA

The Adeunis Temp 3 is a Temperature Monitoring 1 Probe which measures and moniters the temperature to provide warnings should thresholds be exceeded, identify temperature loss and record changes. The Temp 3 has applications across terrains from roads to optimize winter service operations, within buildings or monitoring changes in pools.
