### 1. Introduction

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/LoRaWan/LoRaWan06.png" description="LoRaWan Technology" %}

As seen above, the gateways serve as the bridge between your devices and the network server using bandwidth networks like WiFi, Ethernet or Cellular to communicate. LoRaWAN gateways have the ability to recieve LoRa packets from your device, while regular gateways rely on WiFi or Cellular technology (3G, 4G, 5G, etc.). 

Gateways run on an operating system such as Kerlink IoT Station which is run behind the scenes interpreting your device's packets. The Gateway Admin will use this operating system to manage their gateway.

### 2. What Gateways do Microshare work with?
<!--Need to complete this list-->
#### Kerlink Indoor iFemtocell and Indoor iFemtocell Evo

The Kerlink iFemtocell and Kerlink iFemtocell Evolution receives radio transmissions from the Microshare IoT devices in and around your building and uses an integrated cellular/mobile connection to send data securely to the Microshare Smart Network. You will be working with this gateway for the following devices:


#### Kerlink Outdoor iStation

The Kerlink iStation is a carrier-grade LoRaWANÂ® outdoor gateway which receives radio transmissions from the Microshare IoT devices in and around your building or campus. It uses an integrated cellular/mobile connection to send data securely to the Microshare Smart Network. It is fully weatherproof and designed to be installed outdoors but can in some cases be installed internally.You will be working with this gateway for the following devices:

### 3. More information on gateways

The LoRaWAN gateways used by Microshare fall under the class A gateway, where the gateway cannot initiate communication with your device. The gateway can only communicate for a brief window of time with your device if it is prompted to do so by your device. This enforces security and power efficiency for your devices.
