### 1. Introduction

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/LoRaWan/LoRaWan06.png" description="LoRaWan Technology" %}

As seen above, the gateways serve as the bridge between your devices and the network server using bandwidth networks like WiFi, Ethernet or Cellular to communicate. LoRaWAN gateways have the ability to recieve LoRa packets from your device, while regular gateways rely on WiFi or Cellular technology (3G, 4G, 5G, etc.). 

Gateways run on an operating system such as Kerlink IoT Station which is run behind the scenes interpreting your device's packets. The Gateway Admin will use this operating system to manage their gateway.

### 2. What Gateways do Microshare work with?
<!--Need to complete this list-->
#### Indoor iFemtocell and Indoor iFemtocell Evo

The Kerlink iFemtocell and Kerlink iFemtocell Evolution receives radio transmissions from the Microshare IoT devices in and around your building and uses an integrated cellular/mobile connection to send data securely to the Microshare Smart Network. You will be working with this gateway for the following devices:
* Environment Sensors
* Desk Occupancy Sensors
* Office Availability Sensors

#### Outdoor iStation
The Kerlink iStation is a carrier-grade LoRaWANÂ® outdoor gateway which receives radio transmissions from the Microshare IoT devices in and around your building or campus. It uses an integrated cellular/mobile connection to send data securely to the Microshare Smart Network. It is fully weatherproof and designed to be installed outdoors but can in some cases be installed internally.You will be working with this gateway for the following devices:
* Water Temperature Sensor
* Leak Detection Sensor
