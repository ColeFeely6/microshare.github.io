2. [Creating your Microshare Developer Account](./#2-creating-your-microshare-developer-account)
3. [Working with the API](./#3-becoming-familiar-with-the-microshare-api)

5. [Ready for more](./#5-ready-for-more)

---------------------------------------

### 1. Where do I start?
There may seem like a lot of resources for the developer, and this page serves to outline the steps you should follow to learn how to interact with the Microshare Platform. 

After reading the [Overview](/docs/2/technical/quick-start/overview/) of the role of the developer and understanding the [Technical Structure of Microshare](/docs/2/technical/quick-start-microshare-technical-structure), you should get started creating your developer Microshare account, which will give you the ability to create Robots, Rules, Views, Apps, and Device Clusters.

---------------------------------------

### 2. Creating your Microshare Developer account

Follow the steps outlined in the [Create an Account](/docs/2/general-user/quick-start/create-an-account/) page, but make sure to use the [http://dapp.microshare.io](http://dapp.microshare.io) environment. In the developer environment, you will be able to test out creating Device Clusters, Dashboards, editing Views, creating Rules and Robots. 

---------------------------------------

### 3. Becoming familiar with the Microshare API

##### Authentication

First, Head over to the [API Quick Start](/docs/2/technical/api/quick-start/) to install the Postman application, and learn the terminology of Microshare's API. Next
use the [Authentication Guide](/docs/2/technical/api/authentication/) where you will learn how to navigate the security features of Microshare's API by requesting your own token. It is crucial that you complete the Authentication Guide before you move on to the Simple Request tutorial, as you will not be able to make the requests without the authentication.

##### Simple Requests

Following the [Simple Requests tutorial](/docs/2/technical/api/simple-requests/) you will learn how to send and request information to Microshare's API. Understanding these concepts are the fundamental behind working with Robots and Device Clusters moving forward. 

---------------------------------------

### 4. Getting Started with the Microshare Platform

Once you have set yourself up in the developer environment, follow the next steps to interact with the Microshare environment.

##### Device Clusters

[Device Clusters](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform/device-cluster-guide/) allow you to group your devices that are in similar locations, combining the individual devices' data together. From here, you can create apps to display an analyse the cluster's information, and use rules to what extent others may view that information. 

##### Views

[A View](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform/views-guide/) is a component for managing your data access. It lets you send static data, query the data lake, manage content and data formats and also puts controls over data elements along with sharing rules. 

##### Dashboard

[Dashboards](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform/dashboard-guide/) will allow you to organise apps together and eliminate clutter on you manage page. This will be especially be useful for grouping a client's apps together. It is important to note that a lot of the material under the Dashboard Guide fall under the Advanced Developer catagory. 

##### Rules 

[A Rule](/docs/2/technical/microshare-platform/rules-guide/) is a concrete expression of a sharing policy. It allows a data Owner to set the conditions in which a requested Operation will be Granted. Rules only allow sharing. Rules do not prevent sharing. Sharing is blocked by default.

---------------------------------------


### 5. Ready for more?

Head on over to the [Advanced Developer's Roadmap](/docs/2/technical/quick-start/advanced-dev-roadmap/) to take a deeper dive into incteracting with the Microshare platform.
