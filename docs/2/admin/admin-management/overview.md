## 1. What are the Administrator's responsibilities?
---------------------------------------

The Admin owns [device clustors](./what-are-the-administrator's-responsibilities?) and makes the [Rules](./what-are-the-administrator's-responsibilities?) to share data with the appropriate individuals of their organisation. The Admin uses a Microshare Default ID:
* ms_admin@clientName.com 

The Admin has jurisdiction over what Business Event users (those users who own site specific Robots and apps) and what regular users have access too.
