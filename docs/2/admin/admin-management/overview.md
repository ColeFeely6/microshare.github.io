## 1. What are the Administrator's responsibilities?
---------------------------------------

The Admin owns [Device Clusters](./what-are-the-administrator's-responsibilities?) and makes the [Rules](./what-are-the-administrator's-responsibilities?) to share data with the appropriate individuals of their organisation. The Admin uses a Microshare Default ID:
* ms_admin@clientName.com 

The Admin has jurisdiction over what Business Event users (those users who own site specific Robots and apps) and what regular users have access too. 

While reading this documentation if you encounter any issues or have any feedback please do not hesitate to contact us at `docs@microshare.io`. 


## 2. What Data or Apps are normally Shared?
---------------------------------------
By default the data from a device is NOT SHARED. Only the device cluster's owner can see it (assuming they use their own auth for the cluster). In most cases, this will require a share rule for that record type to be created in order to allow other parties to view the data

Apps, however, by default are shared at the organizational level. They do not require share rules to be created. They can't be restricted in access although they can be filtered out of the default user view using favorites. 

Robots are visible to only the creator. There is not currently a mechanism to share robots.
