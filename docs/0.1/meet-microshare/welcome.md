## Introduction

Microshare makes it easy for you to work with shareable data. Once your data is uploaded on our platform, we provide all the tools you need to transform, visualize and share the data you want the way you want.

While reading this documentation if you encounter any issues or have any feedback please do not hesitate to contact us at `docs@microshare.io`

## Platform

Microshare™ is a Data Governance Platform for the Internet of Every Thing, providing a solution to data privacy, security, audit, confidentiality and micro-sharing.

The Policy Fabric™ platform and product suite can take massive amounts of data, stored in thousands of locations, generated from thousands of sources and put it into the hands of a single, empowered individual to use as needed.

You can access the Microshare platform [right here](https://msaf.microshare.io/composer).
