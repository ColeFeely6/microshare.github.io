# Getting Started

In this tutorial you're going to program the [SODAQ ExpLoRer board](http://support.sodaq.com/sodaq-one/explorer/){:target="_blank"} using the [Aurduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software){:target="_blank"}.  This tutorial is going guide you in programming the SODAQ Explorer board and connecting it to the [The Thinks Network (TTN)](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/)

**Important** You must be within range of The Things Network coverage area or gateway.  You can see the [The Things Network Coverage Map](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/map){:target="_blank"} to check coverage in your area or install your own [LoRaWAN gateway](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/gateway/){:target="_blank"} connected to The Things Network.  If you are **not** within The Things Network coverage area your device will not connect and transmit data to the The Things Network platform.

## Arduino Desktop IDE

- Download & Install the [Arduino Desktop IDE](../arduino_ide)

### Configure Arduino for the SODAQ ExpLoRer Libraries

- Open Arduino IDE
- Click `File` > `Preferences`
- In the `Addittional Boards Manager URLs` field enter this url to set the SODAQ Explorer board's libraries `http://downloads.sodaq.net/package_sodaq_samd_index.json`
- Click `OK`

### Configure Arduino Board Manager

- Click `Tools` > `Boards` > `Boards Manager`
- Type `SODAQ` in the filter text field
- Click the `Intstall` butons for each of the SODAQ devices listed
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/sodaq_explorer_install_libs.png" description="Install the SODAQ Board Libraries" %}

### Download the SODAQ ExpLoRer Arduino Sketch

The arduino platform maintains it's source code in `sketches` which are files with a `.ino` extension. The code that we're using for this tutorial can be found in the i Github repo https://github.com/microshare/hackiot_examples
https://github.com/thethingsnetwork/arduino-device-lib 






## Register for a The Things Network Account

If you don't have a TTN account go over to the [The Things Network website](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/register){:target="_blank"} & register for an account.  After registering and logging into your TTN account go to the [TTN Console Dashboard](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/)

### TTN Console

When registering a new device in the Senet portal interface do the following.

- Generate a `DevEUI` by clicking the `Senetâ€™s EUI Registry` link under the DevEUI Field. This will assign the device a DevEUI in the platform.
- Activate Type:  `OTAA`
- Device Type:  `Nucleo + ST SX1276 Shield`

### Capture Required LoRa Device Keys  #################################################################
#######################################################

After adding your new device be sure to capture the MSB Hex Formated Numbers which resembles this example `{0x00,0x22,0x09,0x00,0x00,0x01,0x03,0x04}`

Get the values for the following keys:

- Device EUI - You'll have to convert the `DevEUI` value from the Senet portal to the `MSB Hex` formatted number mentioned above. For example if you have the number `12345678` the `MSB Hex` value is: `{ 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78 }`. Break the values into pairs then prefix the number pairs with `0x` and use a comma to separate the pairs. Braces `{   }` must surround the entire `MSB` formatted value

- App EUI - You can click the `Copy` icon next to the MSB number
- AppKey - You can click the `Copy` icon next to the MSB number

You will program the device with these values.

### Configure the Devices for OTAA Activation

Here you're going to change the values to some variables in the source code to match the values assigned to your device in the Senet platform.

In the System Workbench IDE:

- Expand the `mlm32l07x01` project in the Project Explorer
- Expand the `Includes` directory
- Find the Project's Include files which is normally the last directory in this list. The file path is similar to this `< filepath to your project directory>/Projects/Multi/Applications/LoRa/End_Node/inc`where the `< filepath to your project directory>` value is the location of your project on disk.
- Expand the `inc` directory and open these files in the IDE:
    - `hw_conf.h`
    - `Commissioning.h`

Open `main.c` file

- Expand the `Projects\End_Node\` directory
- Open the `main.c` file

### Configure hw_conf.h File    

The `hw_conf.h` file has some variables that should be set when using a [sensor shield](http://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks01a2.html){:target="_blank"} or when you need to debug your application.

- If you have a [sensor shield](http://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks01a2.html) attached the device then unComment the `#define SENSOR_ENABLED` statement

### Configure Commissioning.h File

At this point you're ready to configure the Senet `OTAA` values for your device.

Open the `Commissioning.h` file. Find the following statements in the code & replace their values

- #define STATIC_DEVICE_EUI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         `1`
- #define LORAWAN_DEVICE_EUI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       `Device EUI value from Senet Platform converted to MSB Hexidecimal format`
- #define LORAWAN_APPLICATION_EUI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  `App EUI value from Senet Platform`
- #define LORAWAN_APPLICATION_KEY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  `AppKey value from Senet Platform`
- Save your changes

### Configure main.c File

The payload data that this device is sending will be formatted using the Cayenne LPP format

- Uncomment the `//#define CAYENNE_LPP` statement
- #define LORAWAN_ADR_ON  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   `1`
- #define LORAWAN_CONFIRMED_MSG  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      `ENABLE`

### Build the Binary

After configuring the device with the appropriate values from the Senet platform you can now build/compile the project which will produce an application binary file.

- Click the `Project` Menu > `Build All` or Press CTRL-B to build
- You should see a **Successful Build** message in the IDE's Console Tab

### Program the Device

The binary file is ready to be uploaded to the device.

- Connect the device via USB to your computer
- Open a file explorer window and find the attached device. It should appear as an external device and have a name similar to `DIS_L072Z`

Now you need to grab the binary and upload to the device.

- Browse to `< filepath to your project directory> /Projects/Multi/Applications/LoRa/End_Node/SW4STM32/B-L072Z-LRWAN1/mlm32l07x01/Debug/` where the `< filepath to your project directory>` value is the location of your project on disk.
- Find the `mlm32l07x01.bin` file and Copy/Paste or Drag & Drop it into the `DIS_L072Z` device listed in your operating systems file explorer
- The device led will flash green & red while the device is being programmed and will remain solid green or red when complete.

Congratulations! The device is now running the code that you compiled.  Next we'll check the Senet dashboard to see actual LoRaWAN traffic being collected from your device.

### Confirm the Device is Transmitting to Senet

Log into the Senet Portal and click on your registered B-L072Z device.  If the device is transmitting properly then you should see data in the Senet device portal in a few minutes. Use the [Senet User Interface Documentation](http://docs.senetco.io/docs/#user-interface) to learn about the Senet UI

If you're not seeing any data after a few minutes then:

- Confirm you properly configured the code with the proper values from this tutorial
- Ensure the code compiled without any Errors
- Copy the `.bin` file to the device again using steps in `Programming the Device` section
- Ensure that you are withing range of a Senet LoRaWAN Gateway or in an area within Senet Outdoor coverage check the [coverage map here](http://www.senetco.com/coverage/){:target="_blank"}
